You first need to download the original images from [this](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet/tree/master/data/membrane/train/aug) link. We did perform ourselves the augmentation but this allow reprucibility by using all the same images. 
then use the preprocess.py file to obtain the images that we use with our network.
