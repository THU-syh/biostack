# Image registration

The purpose of this repository is to provide an overview of github repositories on non-parametric image registration.

All our code is written in python using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) except for our original deep-learning registration work [[Yang16]](#yang16) which is written in lua using [torch](http://torch.ch/).

Mermaid is a registration toolkit making use of automatic differentiation for rapid prototyping.
It includes various image registration models. In particular, stationary velocity field models
 (both based on velocity fields and momentum fields), scalar vector momentum Large
  Displacement Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) models as well as the more generalized Region-specific Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping model (RDMM).

# EasyReg

EasyReg is an extension that builds on Mermaid, providing a simple interface to Mermaid and other popluar registration packages.

The currently supported methods include Mermaid-optimization (i.e., optimization-based registration) and Mermaid-network (i.e., deep network-based registration methods using the mermaid deformation models, like SVF, LDDMM, RDMM...).
We also added some supports on [ANTsPy](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy), [NiftyReg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg) and Demons(embedded in [SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org/SimpleITK/resources/software.html)).

The EasyReg repository can be found here:

# Related work

The first work on deep-learning for non-parametric medical image registration [[Yang16]](#yang16) predicted the initial momentum of an LDDMM solution, hence was already able to guarantee diffeomorphic transformations. Because it is based on patch-wise predictions, it can be applied to very large images if needed. This work was extended and extensively analyzed in [[Yang17]](#yang17), showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art optimization-based deformable image registration approaches; it also included deep-network models to predict displacement and velocity fields. Follow-up work focused on learning the registration metric [[Niethammer19]](#niethammer19); jointly learning to predict affine transformations and a nonparametric transformation [[Shen19a]](#shen19a) (including multi-step approaches and training to encourage symmetric models); as well as extensions of the LDDMM approach to spatio-temporal regularizers (i.e., that move with the deforming images) also within a deep-network approach [[Shen19b]](#shen19b).
