Dashboard
=============

The Dashboard is designed to give you a summary of your ClarityNLP instance at a glance.
The Dashboard shows you the following:

* The document types (and number of each type) stored in your Solr instance
* The NLPQL queries you have created and saved via the `Query Builder`_
* The name, date, runtime, cohort size, and validation status of your NLPQL jobs

Additional Features

If you would like to quickly navigate to the results of one your recent jobs,
you can click on that job's row in the results table to go directly to the results
