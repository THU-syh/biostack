 COMPARISON:  None available.

 Three views of the lateral lumbar spine are obtained. Two post-processing
 techniques used.

 Assuming the lowermost lumbar-type vertebral body to be L5, the initial two
 views indicate a marker position at the L4/L5 interspace.  Disc spaces are
 decreased at L4/5 and L5/1. The third view shows disc fusion devices and
 screws at L2/3, L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1.  For further details, please consult the
 operative note from the online medical record with the same date.

 AP CHEST, 1:59 P.M., [**11-17**].

 HISTORY:  Delirium, suspect pneumonia.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging:

 The sharp margin of the region of consolidation in the infrahilar left lower
 lobe suggests this is atelectasis rather than pneumonia, but does not really
 exclude infection.  There are no other regions of lung which are suspicious
 for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion and the heart is normal size.
 The mediastinum is probably widened at the level of the aortic arch, but it is
 difficult to separate the edge of the mediastinal soft tissues from large
 thoracic vertebral osteophytes deviating the paraspinal line.  When feasible,
 upright conventional views should be obtained to see if there is really
 mediastinal adenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is 66 year old male with PMH of hypertension, alcohol abuse,
diabetes and DJD admitted for L3-S1 fusion hospital course complicated by alcohol withdrawal requiring brief MICU course for hypertensive urgency and frequent CIWA.
Surgery Course:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15772**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 4**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**3213-11-11**] and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 he returned to the operating room for a scheduled L3-S1 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note
for further details. The second surgery was also without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was stable. A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at the time of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop check when it was removed due to a LLE motor block. He was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#2 from the second procedure. He was
fitted with a lumbar warm-n-form brace for comfort. .
On post-op day 3, [**11-16**], pt was noted to have tremulousness w/
incomprehensible seech.  His ETOH history was taken, and he endorsed drinking [**5-31**] alcoholic drinks (typically vodka and tea) nightly.  There was concern that he was withdrawing from EtOH and he was started on ativan per CIWA.  He became delirious with hallucinations, concerning for DTs.  He was transferred to MICU for stabilization and close monitoring.
He was discharged on oxycodone 5-10 mg PO every 4 hr as needed
for pain in addition to oxycodone SR 20 mg PO twice daily. He will need further pain control optimization. .
#EtOH withdrawal.  In the MICU, he was continued on IV ativan
CIWA scale.  He became hypertensive and was started on IV
labetolol for BP control.  By POD#5, he had been off benzodiazepines for 24 hours and his mental status was at his baseline.  He was weaned off IV labetolol and restarted on his home BP meds, and transferred to the floor.  Of note, pt did not experience any seizures during withdrawal.  He reports that he has nver been hospitalized for EtOH withdrawal in the past. .
On the floor, his CIWA score did not necessitate further
benzodiazepine treatment.  He continued to have pain, and was treated with IV opioids and then transitioned to a PO regimen consisting of standing oxycontin q12h with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain.  He was seen and evaluated by physical therapy, who [**Hospital 8694**] rehab. .
#Hypertension: pt initially hypertensive during initial
withdrawal symptoms but on floor pt was normotensive and discharged on his home medication regimen. .
#Gout: While in the MICU pt had gout flare in Left great toe.
He was given one dose of 1.2mg colchicine and was thence
continued on colchicine 0.6mg daily.  At time of discharge his pain had improved but joint was still inflammed. .
#Diabetes: pt was hyperglycemic to 300's while on floor.  He was
managed on ISS and sugars improved.  When hyperglycemic his anion gap remained normal but was found to be hyponatremic and mildly hyperkalemic, which was attributed to osmotic diuresis. Pt's potassium normalized with BG control, although was still
mildly hyponatremic.  He was d/ced on home regimen of metformin in addition to sliding scale insulin.
He will need further insulin regimen titration.
.
Hyponatremia: Pt was slightly hyponatremic on day of discharge
with Na of 131.  Likely secondary to osmotic diuresis.  Pt does appear euvolemic so could also be secondary to ADH release in setting of significant pain and as side effect of opiates.
He will need safety labs (chem 7) drawn on [**3213-11-24**] to be
reviewed by his rehab MD. .
Normocytic Anemia: has not been worked up in past, MCV is normal
and no evidence of pan-cytopenia so less likely it's from EtOH toxicity.  Anemia could be secondary to blood loss from surgery.  No signs of active bleeding during this admission.  Will be
followed as outpatient. .
Hyperlipidemia: pt was switched to rosuvastatin 20mg daily
because of concern for interaction with treatment doses of colchicine.  Will need outpt management to adjust dose accordingly. .
*********Incidental finding*************
Hilar adenopathy on CXR: will need repeat chest xr and f/u as
outpatient .
Transitional:
- outpt workup for anemia
- needs counseling for EtOH abuse
- Likely needs to be on insulin for diabetes
- needs repeat chem 7 to make sure sodium normalizes
- follow up for hilar adenopathy
- PCP follow up for hyperlipidemia management

withdrawal, gout flare, hypertensive urgency, acute renal failure, acute anemia from post-operative blood loss

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15772**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were to the hospital
for the following operation: ANTERIOR/POSTERIOR Lumbar Decompression With Fusion.  The surgery did not have any
complications, but after spending several days in the hospital you went into alcohol withdrawal causing delirium.  We admitted you to the ICU for this condition and treated you with medications.  After several days, your condition improved. However, it is important that you abstain from alcohol and
enroll with supportive services such as alcoholics anonymous. We now believe that you are safe to go to rehabilitation to get
stronger.
We have made the following changes to your home medications:
STOP Hydrochlorothiazide
STOP your home pain medication and START oxycodone 5 mg every 4
hours as needed for pain and oxycodone 20 mg ER by mouth twice daily for baseline pain CHANGE crestor from 40 mg to 20 mg daily
START colchicine 0.6 mg daily for GOUT FLARE and gout
maintenance START senna and colace for constipation while taking pain
medications START folic acid, thiamine, vitamin B12 for nutrition
START clonidine for blood pressure
START insulin in addition to your metformin for blood sugar
control.
After the operation:
-Activity: You should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for
2 weeks. You will be more comfortable if you do not sit or stand
more than ~45 minutes without getting up and walking around.
-Rehabilitation/ Physical Therapy:
2-3 times a day you should go for a walk for 15-30 minutes as
part of your recovery. You can walk as much as you can tolerate.

-Limit any kind of lifting.

-Diet: Eat a normal healthy diet. You may have some constipation
after surgery. You have been given medication to help with this issue.
-Brace: You have been given a brace. This brace is to be worn
for comfort when you are walking. You may take it off when sitting in a chair or while lying in bed.
-Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days. If the incision is
draining cover it with a new sterile dressing. If it is dry then you can leave the incision open to the air. Once the incision is completely dry (usually 2-3 days after the operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a bath or pool. If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet. Cover it with a sterile dressing. Call the office.
-You should resume taking your normal home medications. No
NSAIDs.

-You have also been given Additional Medications to control your
pain. Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so please plan ahead. You can either have them mailed to your home or pick them up at the clinic located on [**Hospital Ward Name 60**] 2. We are not allowed to call in or fax narcotic
prescriptions (oxycontin, oxycodone, percocet) to your pharmacy. In addition, we are only allowed to write for pain medications
for 90 days from the date of surgery.
Please call the office if you have a fever>101.5 degrees
Fahrenheit and/or drainage from your wound.

Followup Instructions:
With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 10 days, please call to arrange.
Please call the clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2643**]) to confirm your
appointment that has been scheduled.
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor after you are
discharged from rehab: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 15773**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD

 LUMBAR SPINE [**3213-11-25**]

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Anterior and posterior fusion L2 through L5, assess
 healing.

 FINDINGS:

 Two views of the lumbar spine demonstrate anterior and posterior fusion from
 L2 through L5 with interbody fusion devices, anterior screws, and pedicle
 screws and posterior fixation rods.  Lumbar vertebral body height and
 alignment are maintained.  Endplate sclerosis at L2-3 with osteophytosis.  Of
 note, there has been interval fracture of the posterior superior aspect of the
 L2 vertebral body best seen on the lateral radiograph.  Fracture may involve
 the pedicle as well.  This is not well appreciated on the frontal radiograph
 as this is obscured by bowel gas and abdominal contents.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Anterior and posterior fusion, with interval fracture of posterior
 superior endplate of L2, possible extension to the pedicle.

 An e-mail regarding the findings was sent to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1237**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of
 dictation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain. Assess L2 fracture.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT lumbar spine without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformatted images provided.

 COMPARISON:  L-spine radiograph [**3213-11-25**] and L-spine radiograph
 [**3213-11-12**].

 FINDINGS:

 The alignment of the lumbar spine is preserved.  The patient is status post
 laminectomy at L2 through L4, status post L2 through S1  anterior and
 posterior osteometallic  fusion.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in
 the spine.

 There is a L2 superior posterior endplate corner fracture, as described on the
 [**3213-11-25**] radiograph.  The fracture extends in the pedicles bilaterally (7:35,
 8:25, 8:39), with slight distraction of the upper portion of the pedicles and
 posterior elements.  In addition, there is a vertical lucent line through L2
 vertebral body (8:38) which could suggest vertical extension through the
 posterior vertebral body of L2.

 There is a focal divot along the superior endplate of L3 (8:38), without
 definite fracture.

 A faintly seen lucent line along the posterosuperior corner of the L3
 vertebral (8:32, 39) likely also represents a nondisplaced fracture.

 There is deformity through the L5 vertebral body, which is likely also
 indicative of fracture,

 There is a question of a hyperdense material in the spinal canal at level L2
 anteriorly, could be a small hematoma; however, evaluation is suboptimal due
                                                             (Over)

 to limitations of CT technique and due to artifact (3:25).

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  L2 superior posterior endplate corner fracture extending in the pedicles
 bilaterally, with slight distraction.  Lucent line vertically through L2
 vertebral body may represent extension into L2 vertebral body.
 2.  L4 nondisplaced superior posterior endplate corner fracture.
 3.  L5 vertebral body fracture.
 4.  Divot along superior endplate of L3 - ? schmorls node; no definite
 fracture.  This could be correlated with any previous (outside)
 cross-sectional studies.
 5.  Question of hyperdense material in the spinal canal at level L2 could be
 small hematoma; however, evaluation is suboptimal due to artifact.

 A voice mail was left for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to communicate the finding at 5:15 p.m.
 on [**3213-11-26**] and also e-mail was sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the same time.

 HISTORY:  Fusion.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**11-25**], there is little overall change
 in the appearance of the extensive fusion procedure extending posteriorly from
 L2 through S1 and anteriorly from L3 through S1 with interbody spacers in
 place.  No evidence of hardware-related complication.

 LUMBAR SPINE RADIOGRAPHS

 HISTORY:  Lumbar spondylosis and stenosis status post L2 through L5 fusion.

 COMPARISONS:  [**3214-1-3**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Lumbar spine, AP and lateral.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post posterior lumbar fusion extending from
 L2 through S1 with a similar appearance including interbody fusion devices
 from L2-L3 through L5-S1.  Bone graft material is present along associated
 posterior elements.  On the prior postoperative radiograph, there was a defect
 through the posterior superior part of the L2 vertebral body which shows
 interval bony healing and there is less lucency about pedicle screws within
 the L2 vertebral body.  Subchondral sclerosis about L1-L2, with
 moderate-to-severe narrowing, however, appears greater suggesting sequelae of
 healing and possibly increasing superimposed degenerative change above the
 level of the fusion.  Likewise, increasing right lateral bridging osteophyte
 is associated with these changes spanning the right L1-L2 level, where is
 increased kyphotic angulation.

 IMPRESSION:  Healing lucency along the superior posterior margin of L2.
 Increasing degenerative changes and slight kyphotic angulation, however, at
 L1-L2.
