	"text": "FINDINGS:\n\n There is slight interval decrease in the large, heterogenous, irregular lesion\n with central necrosis and rim enhancement.  The craniocaudal dimension of the\n lesion measures 56 mm.  The transverse dimension of the superior aspect of the\n tumor measures 32 x 30 mm, previously 38 x 33 mm.\n Similarly, the inferior aspect of the tumor measures 27 x 19 mm, previously 32\n x 21 mm. The previously seen thick rim enhancement is\n also relatively thinner when compared to the prior examination.\n\n\n On ASL the dominant lesion demonstrates perfusion along the posterior rim and\n also in the posterior parietal lesion. The dominant lesion also shows\n restricted diffusion. Additionally, there is a stable focus of enhancement in\n the right temporal lobe just anterior to the inferior aspect of the main tumor\n and in the right posterior temporal lobe.  There are no new areas of abnormal\n enhancement identified.  There is stable foci of high signal intensity on\n FLAIR and T2-weighted images in the anterior tip of the right temporal lobe,\n concerning for additional foci of tumor.\n\n Overall, there is interval decrease in the subfalcine herniation towards the\n left which measures 3 mm, previously 6 mm.  The ASL images are degraded due to\n artifact from motion.  There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n  The major intracranial vascular flow voids are unremarkable.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Slight interval decrease in the size of the large irregular necrotic\n rim-enhancing mass as described above.\n\n 2.  Stable-to-minimal interval decrease in the satellite lesions with no new\n lesions identified."
