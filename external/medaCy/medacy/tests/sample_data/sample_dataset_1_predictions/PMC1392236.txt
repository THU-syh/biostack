Materials and Methods 
PM preparation. 
ROFA was collected from a precipitator at Boston Edison Co., Mystic Power Plant number 4 (Everett, MA). ROFA particle size and elemental composition from this source have been previously characterized (Antonini et al. 2002; Roberts et al. 2004). ROFA particles were of respirable size with a count mean diameter of 2.2  m. We used TiO2 (mean diameter of 1  m; Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) to determine if any ROFA effects were substance specific. ROFA and TiO2 samples (suspended in 300  L sterile saline) were sonicated for 1 min before IT instillation. 
Experimental animals. 
Male Sprague Dawley rats (7 8 weeks of age) were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) and housed at the West Virginia University Health Sciences Center in an animal facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. To ensure that all methods were performed humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering, all experimental procedures were approved by the West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee. 
IT instillation. 
Rats were lightly anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of sodium methohexitol and IT instilled with ROFA (0.1 or 0.25 mg/rat) according to previously established methods (Brain et al. 1976). We have previously shown that these doses partially impair or completely abolish endothelium-dependent arteriolar dilation in the rat spinotrapezius muscle (Nurkiewicz et al. 2004). Rats in the vehicle control group were IT dosed with 300  L sterile saline. Rats in the particle control group were dosed with TiO2 (0.1 or 0.25 mg/rat). After IT instillation, all rats recovered for 24 hr before BAL, histology, or intravital microscopy experiments. 
Collection of BAL samples for measurement of pulmonary inflammation and damage. 
Rats were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (  100 mg/kg, ip). A tracheal cannula was inserted, and BAL was performed through the cannula using ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline as previously described (Nurkiewicz et al. 2004). 
BAL fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and albumin protein assays. 
BAL fluid LDH activities were determined as a marker of cytotoxicity, and albumin concentrations were determined as an indicator of the integrity of the alveolar air blood barrier. Both assays were measured as previously described (Nurkiewicz et al. 2004). 
Alveolar macrophage (AM) chemiluminescence (CL). 
AM CL was determined as previously described (Nurkiewicz et al. 2004) to evaluate reactive oxygen species production by AM. 
Histology and immunohistochemistry. 
To more thoroughly identify pulmonary inflammation, microscopic sections of lungs from rats treated with saline or exposed to 0.1 mg ROFA were evaluated. Lung tissue sections were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist for morphologic alterations. Semi-quantitative pathology scores were calculated for alveolar inflammation in each slide. The pathology score was the sum of numeric conversion of the severity (none, minimal, mild, moderate, marked, or severe) and distribution (none, focal, locally extensive, multifocal, multifocal and coalescent, or severe) of tissue alterations to produce a pathology score on a scale of 0 10 (Porter et al. 2001). 
To characterize cell types associated with systemic microvascular inflammation, histologic analysis was performed on the spinotrapezius muscle of rats 24 hr after exposure to ROFA or TiO2 (0.1 or 0.25 mg for each particle type). The muscle was removed from the rat, fixed immediately in 10% formalin, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) allowed positive identification of neutrophils and eosinophils. 
To localize the hemoprotein MPO in the spinotrapezius muscle of rats 24 hr after treatment with saline or 0.25 mg ROFA, immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (Eiserich et al. 2002). Sections were deparaffinized and, after microwave antigen retrieval in citrate buffer pH 6, were incubated overnight at 4 C with a polyclonal antibody against MPO (1:500; Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc., La Jolla, CA). An Alexa 488 fluorescent-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to localize MPO. After counter-staining the nuclei with diamidinophenylin-dole (DAPI; Molecular Probes), sections were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope system (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). 
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
The left and right spinotrapezius muscles were excised from rats 24 hr after treatment with saline or 0.25 mg ROFA, and the microcirculation was dissected from the surrounding skeletal muscle. The pooled microvascular samples from an individual rat were stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 4 C for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using an Array Pure Nano-scale RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI) and analyzed as previously described (Rao et al. 2004). 
Intravital microscopy. 
Rats were anesthetized with sodium thiopental (100 mg/kg, ip) and placed on a heating pad to maintain a 37 C rectal temperature. The trachea was intubated to ensure a patent airway, and the right carotid artery was cannulated to measure arterial pressure. The right spinotrapezius muscle was then exteriorized, superfused with an electrolyte solution, and prepared for microscopic observation as previously described (Nurkiewicz et al. 2004). 
The animal preparation was then transferred to the stage of an intravital microscope. Video images were displayed and videotaped for off-line analysis. During videotape replay, arteriolar inner diameters were measured and venular leukocyte adhesion was quantified. 
Experimental protocols. 
Protocol 1. 
Arteriolar endothelium-dependent dilation was evaluated by assessing the capacity for Ca2+-dependent endothelial nitric oxide formation in response to intraluminal infusion of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Glass micropipettes were filled with a 10-7 M solution of A23187 and inserted into the arteriolar lumen, and A23187 was then infused directly into the flow stream for 2-min periods at ejection pressures of 5, 10, 20, and 40 psi (Nurkiewicz et al. 2004). A 2-min recovery period followed each ejection. At the end of all intravital experiments, adenosine (ADO) was added to the superfusate (10-4 M final concentration) to fully dilate the microvascular network and determine the passive diameter of each arteriole studied. 
Protocol 2. 
To evaluate arteriolar responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation, phenylephrine (PHE) was iontophoretically applied to individual arterioles in rats after exposure to either saline or 0.25 mg ROFA. Micropipettes were filled with a 50-mM solution of PHE in distilled water. The pipette tip was placed in light contact with the arteriolar wall, and a current programmer delivered continuous 2-min ejection currents of 50, 100, and 200 nA (randomly). A 2-min recovery period followed each application. To exclude the possibility that adrenergic stimulation could increase NO production and therefore attenuate the observed constrictions, these experiments were performed during NO synthase (NOS) inhibition with NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (10-4 M final superfusate concentration). 
Protocol 3. 
Adhering or rolling leukocytes in first-order venules of rats after exposure to either saline, 0.25 mg ROFA, or 0.1 mg TiO2 were quantified to characterize microvascular inflammation. Leukocytes that were either stationary or moving but in constant contact with the venular wall for at least 200  m were counted for 1 min in each venule studied. 
Protocol 4. 
Oxidant activity in the arteriolar wall was measured with the tetranitroblue tetrazolium (TNBT) reduction method, which provides a general index of microvascular oxidant stress (Lenda and Boegehold 2002). After 1 hr of continuous exposure to 2% TNBT superfusion, the spinotrapezius muscle was fixed with a 10% formalin solution and excised. The tissue was then viewed with bright-field microscopy, and images of microvessels were digitized and analyzed. Using a 1   5  m photometric window, a series of average pixel intensity measurements were made along the vessel wall and in extravascular regions immediately adjacent to the wall. To assess microvascular wall levels of formazan (the reduction product of TNBT and therefore an index of oxidant activity), the measured pixel intensities were used to calculate microvascular wall light absorption (A): A = ln(l/l), where l is the vessel intensity and l is the intensity for the adjacent extravascular region. The amount of formazan formed is proportional to the level of oxidant activity, and calculated light absorption is linearly related to the amount of formazan present (Lenda and Boegehold 2002). 
Data and statistical analyses. 
Arteriolar diameter (D, in micrometers) was sampled at 10-sec intervals. Resting vascular tone was calculated for each vessel as follows: tone = [(Dpass - D)/Dpass]   100, where Dpass is passive diameter under ADO, and D is the diameter measured during the control period. A tone of 100% represents complete vessel closure, whereas 0% represents the passive state. All data are reported as mean   SE, where n represents the number of arterioles and N represents the number of rats. Statistical analysis was performed by commercially available software (Sigmastat; Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). We used one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the effect of a treatment within a group or differences among groups. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the effects of group, treatment, and group   treatment interactions on measured variables. For all ANOVA procedures, we used the Student-Newman-Keuls method for post hoc analysis to isolate pairwise differences among specific groups. Significance was assessed at the 95% confidence level (p < 0.05) for all tests.
