## Description

The **HELiCAL** project is a _bioinformatics-based utility_ - designed as a web app/utility - for biologists and technologists to work with biological data. 

The intent of the project is to provide basic, intermediate, and advanced _algorithmic operations for genomic data processing_ in an optimized and user-friendly manner. 

Through optimized algorithms design, modular programmatic complexity, and accessible code architectures, I aim to produce a _full-stack Python application_ that's open-source and serves an interesting and modern problem space. 

## Features (User Stories)
