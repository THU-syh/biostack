Respiratory infections are the leading cause of childhood deaths in Bangladesh Promoting respiratory hygiene may reduce infection transmission This formative research explored community perceptions about respiratory infections METHODS We conducted 34 indepth interviews and 16 focus group discussions with community members and school children to explore respiratory hygiene related perceptions practices and social norms in an urban and a rural setting We conducted unstructured observations on respiratory hygiene practices in public markets RESULTS Informants were not familiar with the term respiratory infection most named diseases that had no relation to respiratory dysfunction Informants reported that their community identified a number of good behaviors related to respiratory hygiene but they also noted and we observed that very few people practiced these All informants cited hotcold weather changes or using cold water as causes for catching cold They associated transmission of respiratory infections with close contact with a sick persons breath cough droplets or spit sharing a sick persons utensils and food Informants suggested that avoiding such contact was the most effective method to prevent respiratory infection Although informants perceived that handwashing after coughing or sneezing might prevent illness they felt this was not typically feasible or practical CONCLUSION Community perceptions of respiratory infections include both concerns with imbalances between hot and cold and with persontoperson transmission Many people were aware of measures that could prevent respiratory infection but did not practice them Interventions that leverage community understanding of persontoperson transmission and that encourage the practice of their identified good

2010 and July 2013 were included Results of PCR detection were compared with local meteorological data for the same period Results Low temperature and vapor pressure VP were associated with weekly incidence of IFA respiratory syncytial virus metapneumovirus bocavirus and adenovirus but no association with relative humidity was found The incidence of human rhinovirus and enterovirus was independent of temperature During seasonal IFA outbreaks the weekly drop of average temperature compared with the week before was strongly associated with the IFA incidence recorded the following week Conclusion A sudden drop in outdoor temperature might activate the annual influenza epidemic in a temperate climate by facilitating aerosol spread in dry air These conditions also seem to affect the incidence of other respiratory pathogens but not human rhino or enterovirus suggesting that routes of infection other than aerosol may be relevant for these agents", "answer": "", "start_index": 0,

2019nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources Results This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019nCoV coronavirus survival is 1324 degree Celsius among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans the humidity range is 5080 of which about 75 humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm month Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus The prediction results show that with the approach of spring the temperature in north China gradually rises and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 1318 degree Celsius The

viruses were inoculated onto a wide range of surfaces used in home and work environments then sampled at set times following incubation at stabilised temperature and humidity Virus genome was measured

recovered from most surfaces tested four hours after application and from some nonporous materials after nine hours but had fallen below the level of detection from all surfaces at 24 h We conclude

medical specialties or clinical situations However telemedicine as a potential tool during epidemics is not as well considered Methods In this paper the application of telemedicine is conceptualised using five possible evidencebased epidemic situations Results The first situation corresponds to asymptomatic individuals mainly homebased living in an epidemicaffected location The application of telemedicine would be through the use of teleconsultation for emergency medical dispatching and would occur when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual The second situation for the application of telemedicine is principally homebased and corresponds to the followup telemonitoring of asymptomatic individuals identified as case contacts Concrete applications of these concepts were used during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa since 2014 The third situation links to symptomatic cases in need of isolation Examples include patients isolated in Taiwan during SARS epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009 as well as H7N9 influenza infected patients in 2013 in China The fourth situation involves teleexpertise when local medical resources do not have the technical expertise for the diagnosis or treatment of a patient and support is required from reference centres The fifth situation corresponds to a healthcare facility under quarantine that would use telemedicine to keep taking care of patients that cannot access the facility as it was the case in June 2015 in Seoul during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus epidemic Conclusion The
