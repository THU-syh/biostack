def: "Multicystic dysplasia of the kidney is characterized by multiple cysts of varying size in the kidney and the absence of a normal pelvicaliceal system. The condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the affected kidney is nonfunctional." [HPO:curators]
comment: Multicystic kidney dysplasia is the result of abnormal fetal renal development in which the affected kidney is replaced by multiple cysts and has little or no residual function. The vast majority of multicystic kidneys are unilateral. Multicystic kidney can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound.

comment: The degree of variation of penis curvature is a continuum, but traditionally 30 degrees is considered the threshold for surgical intervention on chordee. Bowing usually becomes more obvious in an erect penis, but is frequently also palpable when stretching a flaccid penis. Chordee can be congenital or acquired; if the former, it can be associated with Webbed Penis or Hypospadias, which should be coded separately.

comment: Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.

Strictly speaking, the term glossoptosis indicates falling of the tongue and thus can also be forward displacement; however by convention it is only used for backward displacement. Glossoptosis may cause obstruction of the airway.

Both genetic and pharmacologically induced forms of gingival fibromatosis are known. The most common genetic form, hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF), is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, although sporadic cases are common and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported.

This is an acknowledged bundled term, but due to its frequent usage and relative paucity of situations that would call for separate individual assessments of tongue dimensions, the bundled term is retained.

comment: Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.

comment: Palatal width is measured as the distance between the maxillary first permanent molar on the right and left sides, at the lingual cervical line, using a specific device. Palate width is typically assessed subjectively in routine clinical practice. Narrowing is often associated with a High palate, but this should be assessed and coded separately. Gingival overgrowth can give the impression of a narrow palate but should be distinguished and coded separately. The term gothic palate is used to indicate that the roof of the palate is not round but rather has an inverted V-shape, and therefore, only the upper part of the palate is narrow.

comment: Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms also have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Brachycephaly is distinct from Flat occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately.

comment: Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.

Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure.

comment: Objective measurement of the upper facial width is made with spreading calipers. The tips of the calipers are passed over the zygomatic arches until the maximum width is determined. Objective measurement of the lower faces is made with spreading calipers, with the tips firmly pressed against the inferomedial surface of the angle of the mandible.

Measuring width of the philtrum is even more inaccurate than measuring length (vide supra). A broad philtrum may be associated with reduced ridge prominence or a shallow groove, a Smooth philtrum, which should be assessed and coded separately. It may be found with a broad nasal septum.

comment: There is a spectrum of this finding from total absence of the philtral ridges to a some prominence of the ridges. The central groove varies from absent to shallow. Normal values for the frequency of smooth philtrum are available. Grading of the smoothness of the philtrum, used in the assessment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, has been developed. This finding is greatly influenced by the facial expression, and care should be taken to evaluate the philtrum when the face is in a neutral position. A smooth philtrum can be associated with a Long philtrum. However, the two findings should be coded separately.

def: "A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

Otosclerosis is the most common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss in adults, and is generally manifested as nonsyndromic, delayed-onset, conductive hearing loss, but it may also affect the inner ear to cause sensorineural loss. Congenital stapes ankylosis may be difficult to differentiate from otosclerosis when the diagnosis of conductive hearing loss is delayed.

Although the nasal root may be anteriorly placed without increasing the space between the eyes, prominence of the nasal bridge may be accompanied by Telecanthus or ocular Hypertelorism. If such findings are present these should be coded separately. Deep-set eyes may lead to the impression of a prominent nasal bridge, but this finding should be coded separately.

They are usually about the width of the columella, but vary greatly depending on the shape of the nostril. Note that individuals may be described as having a Cleft ala nasi, but have a severely underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted. With severe hypoplasia of the nasal alae, the nasal tip may appear depressed.

comment: The word torticollis comes from Latin words meaning twisted neck. Spasmodic torticollis is a focal dystonia that affects the neck and sometimes the shoulders, leading to involuntary contractions of the neck muscles, abnormal movements and postures of the head and neck. The abnormal movements can have both tonic and clonic components and can results in pain and discomfort. Spasmodic torticollis is the most common focal dystonia.

As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.

comment: Some sources define "exophthalmos" as a protrusion of the globe greater than 18 mm and "proptosis" as a protusion equal to or less than 18 mm. Others define "exophthalmos" as protusion secondary to endocrine dysfunction and "proptosis" as any non-endocrine-mediated protusion (Source: Wikipedia). This finding should be distinguished frm underdevelopment of the supraorbital ridge or maxilla/zygoma. In proptosis, the globe is anteriorly protuberant to the overall plane of the face.

def: "Atrophy of the choroid and retinal layers of the fundus." [HPO:probinson, pmid:20224472]
comment: Choroidal sclerosis is a descriptive term applied to the ophthalmoscopic appearance of prominent white choroidal vessels in which the blood columns are not seen or are sheathed by white lines. Choroidal sclerosis is a term used to describe a group of genetically heterogeneous retinal dystrophies that share a common funduscopic phenotype of scalloped, well-circumscribed, and confluent chorioretinal atrophic lesions that extend beyond the macula. The term choroidal sclerosis was initially coined because of the sclerotic appearance of choroidal vessels which frequently appear white or light-yellow. However, histologic studies have demonstrated the term to be a misnomer as the principle abnormality is the loss of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the outer retina in the absence of abnormal sclerotic changes in the choroidal vasculature. Therefore, we are making choroidal sclerosis a synonym of chorioretinal atrophy.

Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with residual vision.

comment: Ambylopia can result from visual deprivation during the critical period of development of visual abilities which lasts to about the age of 8 years. Thus, ambylopia can result from strabismus, anisometropia, or high hypermetropia in there is a failure to form a focused image in one or both eyes.

comment: The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.

comment: Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.

def: "A stereotypy is a repetitive, simple movement that can be voluntarily suppressed. Stereotypies are typically simple back-and-forth movements such as waving of flapping the hands or arms, and they do not involve complex sequences or movement fragments. Movement is often but not always rhythmic and may involve fingers, wrists, or more proximal portions of the upper extremity. The lower extremity is not typically involved. Stereotypies are more commonly bilateral than unilateral." [HPO:probinson]
comment: An abnormality of behavior characterized by one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior such as inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements), or persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. The behaviour does not serve an observable goal. In general the movements are not aimed at the environment, but at the person itself. Stereotypical behaviour is seen especially in children with sensory, intellectual and/or cognitive handicaps.

comment: Sprengel deformity is associated with malposition and dysplasia of the scapula and also involves regional muscle hypoplasia or atrophy, which causes disfigurement and limitation of shoulder movement. Sprengel deformity may be unilateral or bilateral and occur in isolation or as a syndromic component. Abduction of shoulder beyond 90 degrees is impossible.

comment: Ther terms hyperhidrosis and diaphoresis are often used interchangeably to describe excessive perspiration. Diaphoresis can be used to refer to excessive sweating that occurs with certain diseases (secondary hyperhidrosis). Since the HPO does not intend to provide coess for etiologies or diseases, we will use these terms interchangeably to refer to excessive perspiration without an appropriate cause such as hot and humid weather.

def: "A congenital vascular malformation consisting of superficial and deep dilated capillaries in the skin which produce a reddish to purplish discolouration of the skin." [HPO:sdoelken, PMID:22483320]
comment: Port-wine stains generally become deeper, thicker, and darker in color over time, mainly as a result of progressive vascular dilatation. As a result of these changes, which are generally much more evident on the face, patients often develop hypertrophy and nodularity after the third or fourth decade of life. The fact that nodules are only found on the face and do not occur in childhood has led some authors to suggest that port-wine stains might actually be hamartomatous lesions.

comment: Acne can be a consequence of increased sebum production as a result of increased testosterone production (in males and females) during puberty. Blockage of hair follicles canresult from accumulating keratin and sebum, resulting in plug formation called microcomedone, which can enlarge just beneath the surface of the skin in the pore itself. It may become visible as a closed comedone (whitehead), a firm white papule. Further enlargement leads to an open comedone (blackhead). The comedones are not themselves inflammatory. Proprionibacterium acnes can induce inflammation, leding to an inflammed, red papule.

comment: The reduced soft tissue is typically abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis muscle bulk. Detection of this abnormality entails clinical judgment, especially in mild cases. The bulk of the muscle mass around the base of the thumb is diminished, and there may be a mild concavity over the volar aspect of the first metacarpal. When the deficiency is unilateral, comparison between the two hands will point up the often-subtle change in contour of the thenar muscles. If the degree of involvement is severe, the palm may taper in width proximally.

comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

comment: By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).

def: "Reduced strength of muscles." [HPO:probinson, pmid:15832536]
comment: It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

Myoclonus is characterized by sudden unidirectional movement due to muscle contraction (positive myoclonus) or due to sudden brief muscle relaxtion (negative myoclonus).

comment: This term applies to a disease whose etiology is related to an alteration in DNA that occurs after conception. Somatic mutations  occur in all body tissues throughout life and are not present in the germline from which the individual developed (The Greek word soma means body.) The majority of somatic mutations have no phenotypic effect. However, occasionally they may have functional consequences that confer a selective advantage on the cell owing to preferential growth or survival. These so-called driver mutations may ultimately lead to cancer or other diseases.

comment: The standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. Although it is easy to measure the width of teeth, and the definition is made with reference to the width of teeth, macrodontia actually means that the overall size of the tooth is increased.

def: "A narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract that can occur at the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis) or just below the pulmonary valve (infundibular stenosis)." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae). Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.

Bicuspid aortic valvue is a malformation of a commissure (small space between the attachment of each cusp to the aortic wall) and the adjacent parts of the two corresponding cusps forming a raphe (the fused area of the two underdeveloped cusps turning into a malformed commissure between both cusps; the raphe is a fibrous ridge that extends from the commissure to the free edge of the two underdeveloped, conjoint cusps)."

comment: A normal aortic valve is composed of three aortic-valve cusps, each semilunar in appearance. The leaflets are housed within a small dilatation of the proximal aorta associated with each cusp, called the sinuses of Valsalva or aortic sinuses, and their association with the respective coronary ostia identifies them: left, right, and non-coronary sinuses. Each cusp is attached to the wall of the aorta by the outward edges of its semicircular border, and the attachment point between each leaflet is called a commissure [PMID:24827036].

def: "Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta." [HPO:probinson, PMID:23909637]
comment: Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is often a discrete obstruction commonly located in the descending thoracic aorta. More specifically, it is usually located in the juxtaductal position immediately distal to the left-subclavian artery in a left-sided arch. The hallmark clinical finding in coarctation of the aorta is hypertension proximal to the lesion, with diminished blood pressure distal to the obstruction. Consequently, clinical diagnosis can be made by the presence of diminished lower extremity pulses, differences in timing between upper extremity central pulses (often brachial) and lower extremity central pulses (often femoral), or the presence of a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient.

comment: During the development of the heart, the outflow tract initially connects exclusively with the primitive right ventricle and must undergo extensive remodelling to divide into a separate pulmonary artery and aorta; subsequently, there is continued remodelling to establish direct continuity from the left ventricle to the aorta. DORV encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic arrangements and pathophysiologic disturbances. At one end of the spectrum, it mimics tetralogy of Fallot in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, or a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the absence of such stenosis. At the other end of the spectrum, it behaves like transposition of the great arteries with a VSD.

def: "An abnormality of the functioning of the vestibular apparatus." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.

comment: Clubfoot is a complex, multifactorial deformity with genetic and intrauterine factors. One popular theory postulates that a clubfoot is a result of intrauterine maldevelopment of the talus that leads to adduction and plantarflexion of the foot. On radiographic projection a clubfoot can be noted as parallel axes of talus and calcaneus.

comment: No objective standard for nail thickness could be identified. An unsupported claim suggests that nails are 0.5 mm in females and 0.6 mm in males. Thin nails are usually brittle, may easily fray, or break at the free edge. Thin nails usually grow slowly but this definition does not require slow growth of the nail. Note that the term koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave. Since it indicates also other characteristics than thin nails, it should not be used to indicate this. The affected digits should be specified.

comment: Congenital vertical talus is characterized by pes valgus, a rigid flatfoot deformity (as opposed to a flexible calcaneovalgus foot) caused by a malpositioned navicular bone at the neck of the talus; the ankle is in severe equinus and the forefoot in dorsiflexion, rocker bottom-like, accompanied by contraction of the talonavicular, deltoid and calcaneal cuboidal ligaments. The foot examination usually reveals a rigid foot with a "reversed" arch, a convex plantar surface, and a deep crease on the lateral dorsal side of the foot. The ankle joint is plantarflexed, while the midfoot and forefoot are extended upward. Lateral foot radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

comment: Metatarsus varus (adductus) is one of the most common foot deformities, that is defined as a transverse plane deformity in Lisfranc's (tarsometatarsal) joints in which the metatarsals are deviated medially. The relationship between talus and calcaneus is normal. On inspection the toes angle abruptly towards the midline, creating a C-shaped lateral foot border with a prominent styloid process of the 5th metatarsal. The result is that the forefoot is twisted inwards relative to the heel, so that the sole faces the midline.

comment: This descriptor is ordered depending on which toes are involved. The overriding toe is labeled, as specified in the introduction (item 3): e.g., T3,4. The ordering of the numbers specifies which toe is dorsal, i.e., with dorsum of the foot facing upward the toe on top is/are recorded first separated by a comma from the digit that is/are overlapped. Toes that are laterally deviated, but do not rest on top of adjacent toes should be coded as Clinodactyly.

comment: Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

There exists a competing classification system by Van der Meulen that divides different types of clefts based on where the development arrest occurs in the embryogenesis. The HPO uses the Tessier classification because it is based on phenotype rather than pathophysiological considerations.

def: "Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are generalized seizures with bilateral symmetrical tonic contraction then bilateral clonic contractions of somatic muscles usually associated with autonomic phenomena." [HPO:curators]
comment: In a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, the patient suddenly loses conciousness, the eyes roll back, and the entire body musculature undergoes tonic contractions. In the clonic phase of the seizure, there are rhythmic contractions of the musculature alternating with relaxation of all muscle groups. Loss of sphincter control during the seizure is common. This form of seizure was formerly commonly called grand mal seizure.

comment: Gliosis generally occurs as a response to tissue damage. Gliosis appears bright on T2 scans upon magnetic resonance imaging, unlike encephalomalacia which follows CSF signal on all sequences. Glial cells, the non-neuronal component of the central nervous system, are divided into microglia and macroglia. The latter are in turn divided into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. The astrocytes and the microglia are the glial cells predominantly responsible for tissue response to injury.

name: Postural instability
def: "A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps." [PMID:25613349]

def: "Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the brain." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Cerebral edema refers to swelling within brain tissue due to the accumulation of fluid, and can occur as in response to almost any insulting agent. Edema canbe observed in and around regions of dead or dying brain, around metastases and abscesses, after traumatic injury, following hypoxic ischemic injury, and around primary brain tumors. There are at least five different types of edema: vasogenic, cytotoxic, hydrostatic, interstitial, and hypoosmotic. Three effects of edema are visible on imaging: (i) loss of gray-white matter differentiation; (ii) swelling of sulci (shrinking of gyri); and (iii) mass effects. On CT scanning, extensive low density may represent vasogenic edema. As the brain swells, not only do the sulci decrease, but all of the CSF spaces of the hemispheres (including the ventricles) decrease as well. Magnetic resonance tomography may show abnormalities of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Phenotype terms involving cerebral edema thus reflect inference about the underlying processes responsible for these abnormalities on brain imaging.

Hyperacusis and phonophobia represent disturbances of central auditory processing without peripheral pathology, often combined with psychosomatic reactions. Phonophobia is generally used to refer to discomfort caused by loud sounds rather than 'fear' of sounds as the etymology of the word might suggest.

Affected patients may report bits of hair on the collar or pillow. Brittle hair can be distinguished from hypotrichosis due to slow or deficient growth (e.g., due to hypotrichosis simplex) and hypotrichosis due to the hair being fine and soft where the hair just wears out too quickly (e.g., due to ectodermal dysplasia).

In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.

Leukodystrophy should be distinguished from leukoencephalopathy (defect causing secondary myelin damage). Note that the term leukodystrophy is most often used to refer to a disease rather than a phenotypic feature, and a more precise description is to be preferred if possible.

comment: Molar tooth appearance results from a lack of normal decussation of superior cerebellar peduncular fiber tracts which in turn leads to enlargement of the peduncles, which also follow a more horizontal course. The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.

However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.

comment: Enlarged parietal foramina is an inherited condition of impaired skull development. It is characterized by enlarged openings (foramina) in the two bones (parietal bones) that form the top and sides of the skull. This condition is due to problems with bone formation (ossification) within the parietal bones. The openings are symmetrical and circular in shape, with variable size ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters wide. Parietal foramina are a normal feature of fetal development, but they usually close by the fifth month of pregnancy.

comment: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

Dorsal hemivertebrae result from a developmental defect in which the anterior chondral centers fail to develop, and ventral hemivertebrae result from failure of the posterior centers to ossify. The affected half of the vertebral body may by hypoplastic or absent, as is the pedicle, and (for thoracic vetebrae) the corresponding rib. The affected half of the vertebral body may also show a fusion or segmentation defect.

comment: The bleeding time test measures the time taken for blood vessel constriction and platelet plug formation to occur. No clot is allowed to form, so that the arrest of bleeding depends exclusively on blood vessel constriction and platelet action. To perform the test, pressure is maintained throughout the test by inflating a sphygmomanometer cuff on the upper arm. The dorsal surface of the forearm is then cleaned, and the bleeding time device placed onto the skin and the trigger is depressed. At 30-second intervals, the flow of blood is blotted with filter paper. The time from puncture to cessation of bleeding is then recorded as the bleeding time. Normal values depend on the device used and other parameters, but are around 2 to 9 minutes.

Ragged red fibers can be visualized with Gomori trichrome staining as irregular and intensely red subsarcolemmal zones, whereas the normal myofibrils are green. The margins of affect fibers appear red and ragged. The ragged-red is due to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria below the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, leading to the appearance of a red rim and speckled sarcoplasm."

def: "An abnormality related to a defect of vertebral separation during development." [HPO:probinson, pmid:23653580, pmid:23801490]
comment: The vertebral column derives from somites, transient paired segments of mesoderm that surround the neural tube in the early embryo. The formation of the vertebrar involves many processes including resegmentation of the rostral and caudal regions of adjacent somites that then fuse to form vetebral elements. Disruption of these processes can a cause of severe segmentation defects of the vetebrae. The frequency of segmentation defects of the vetebra has been estimated at 0.5 of 1000 births. The range of segmentation defects includes left-right uneven formation of somites that results in hemivertebrae or wedge vertebrae. Incomplete segmentation can result in fused segments such as block vertebrae. A failure of the process of resegmentation and migration of the sclerotomal compartment can result in a failure of midline fusion, such as butterlfy vertebrae.

comment: This term refers to a developmental finding resulting in short palms. This term is reserved for individuals with shortening of all four metacarpals 2-5. Individuals with fewer than four shortened metacarpals (in a eudactylous hand, the metacarpals of F2-5) should be coded as Metacarpal, short. See the entry for Hand, small for a discussion of this finding. "Short hand" should not be used as it is a bundle of two readily separable terms, Fingers, short (which, as noted above, can itself be a bundled term) and Palm, short.

The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex).

MAC is generated by sequential addition of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 molecules, which results in the transmembrane pore and eventual cell lysis. Individuals with C8 deficiency tend to have recurrent neisserial infections.

The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.

VT can be subdivided as follows: (i) sustained VT persists for 30 seconds or more; (ii) non-sustained VT lasts less than 30 seconds; (iii) monomorphic VT displays a uniform QRS morphology; and (iv) polymorphic VT displays QRS morphologies that variy from beat to beat. VT is observed most commonly in individuals with structural heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (MI). VT may also be observed in in the setting of drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities or in individuals with Mendelian disease.

In contrast, an aneurysm is defined as a localized dilation of the aorta that is more than 150 percent of predicted (ratio of observed to expected diameter 1.5 or more). Aneurysm should be distinguished from ectasia, which represents a diffuse dilation of the aorta less than 50 percent of normal aorta diameter." []
comment: Aneurysm is considered a severe (pathological) form of dilatation of a segment of a blood vessel. In clinical practice, dilatation and aneurysm are occasionally used interchangably. In this subhierarchy, we therefore use aneurysm as the primary label and list dilatation as a broad synonym.

comment: The ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular because of the large number of atrial impulses that transit the atrioventricular node, making the ventricle partially refractory to further impulses. Atrial fibrillation can cause a number of manifestations including excessive ventricular response with angina pectoris or hypotension in susceptible individuals, syncope, systemic embolization, fatigue, or anxiety. These features should be coded separately.

comment: Reduced convexity of the occiput gives an appearance of flattening. There are no objective measures for convexity of the occiput, and evaluation depends heavily on the experience of the observer. This finding may or may not be accompanied by Brachycephaly (which should be coded separately), and may be observed more frequently when an infant is placed to sleep on his/her back. Occipital plagiocephaly can result from fusion or sclerosis of the lambdoid suture. If unilateral, this is accompanied by unilateral occipital flattening and bulging of the ispilateral frontal bone.

comment: During atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis, the endocardial cushions expand as they are infiltrated by extracellular matrix secreted from the surrounding myocardium. The cushions then fuse and are remodeled to form the atrioventricular valves and septa. Failure of this process results in AVSD, with the degree of severity dependent on the stage at which the developmental failure occurs. AVSD are a spectrum of cardiac malformations that result in a persistent common atrioventricular canal.

def: "An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.

The technique for the thumb placement index is described in detail [Malina et al., 1973; Hall et al., 2007]. Briefly, the thumb placement index is the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the angle of the first interdigital space divided by the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the wrist flexion crease at the base of the thumb. This term should not be used with Preaxial polydactyly.

comment: This term differs from Partial absence of the finger because in that term, the phalanx must be missing, whereas in this term it may be small, but present. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build. Regarding the subjective definition, for individuals who do not have flexion creases, one may determine this by flexing the DIP joint and estimating the length of the terminal segment of the digit. Alternatively, one may be able to palpate the joint.

comment: This feature gives the appearance of a tall forehead, and may or may not include reduction of hair in the temporal areas. This can be distinguished from male pattern baldness as the hairline is the superior boundary of the muscular forehead, which can be actively wrinkled, in contrast to the scalp where no wrinkling can occur. In addition, texture of the skin of the scalp differs from the texture of the skin over the forehead.

comment: Epiphora or tearing is the presence of a watering eye, which is a common complaint for referrals to oculoplastics clinics for evaluation. The etiology of tearing can be divided into two categories: reflex tearing and reduced tear outflow. Reflex tearing is usually secondary to dry eye, inflammation, allergy or other ocular surface disorders, whereas primary hypersecretion of the lacrimal glands is rare. Reduced tear outflow is due to eyelid malposition, tear pump dysfunction caused by eyelid laxity, or obstruction at any portion of the nasaolacrimal drainage system.

There is a spectrum ranging from fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (ankyloglossia inferiorum) to a lingual frenulum that is short or anchored toward the tip of the tongue (sometimes called tongue tie). Ankyloglossia may be associated with a mild indentation of the tip of the tongue, which should not be coded as a Bifid tongue.

comment: We have set an arguably arbitrary threshold to distinguish the object form the subjective finding. While severe degrees of cutaneous syndactyly are clearly objective, more subtle degrees are subjective. We set this threshold to distinguish these two situations. The digits (or parts of) are joined together by tissue that is not normally present between the digits at that point in the P/D axis. A modifier of "complete" may be used if the cutaneous syndactyly extends to the distal end of the nail bed of the digits. The affected digits should be specified. Note that the unqualified term "syndactyly" is no longer allowed as it is unclear whether this refers to bony or cutaneous syndactyly.

comment: Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e.g. brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell's palsy. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.

comment: During lens terminal differentiation, the originally cuboidal lens vesicle cells elongate into long fiber-like cells, or fibers. Y-shaped sutures form because of how the lens epithelial cells proliferate during formation. The Y sutures demarcate the boundaries between the lens cortex, which is peripheral to the Y sutures, and the lens nucleus, which is within and includes the Y sutures. The anterior Y suture is oriented upright, and the posterior Y suture is inverted.

Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.

comment: The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors. Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former. Note that this term does not refer to the situation in which two rows of teeth are seen at the time of eruption of permanent dentition before exfoliation of primary teeth, which can be a normal finding.

comment: This feature is most often seen in the disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is defined histologically by the presence of progressive replacement of right ventricular myocardium with adipose and fibrous tissue often confined to a triangle of dysplasia comprising the right ventricular inflow, outflow, and apex. While these pathologic abnormalities can result in functional and morphological right ventricular abnormalities, they also occur in the left ventricle, producing a DCM phenotype, or can be present in the absence of clinically detectable structural changes in either ventricle. For the purposes of this classification, ARVC is defined by the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional), with or without left ventricular disease, in the presence of histological evidence for the disease and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities in accordance with published criteria.

def: "Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is characterized by prominent left ventricular trabeculae and deep inter-trabecular recesses. The myocardial wall is often thickened with a thin, compacted epicardial layer and a thickened endocardial layer. In some patients, LVNC is associated with left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction, which can be transient in neonates." [pmid:17916581]
comment: Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC), also known as spongy myocardium, is a distinct form of cardiomyopathy occurring in-utero when segments of spongy myocardium fail to transform into compact, mature musculature resulting in prominent myocardial trabeculae, deep intra-trabecular recesses, and decreased cardiac function. It has been proposed that LVNC results from arrest of the compaction process during the second month of embryological development.

comment: A useful guide is to imagine that a line connecting the glabella to the anterior most part of the mandible touches the top of the philtrum where it meets the base of the columella. The glabella is the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose. If the superior philtrum is anterior to this line the face is convex, if the superior philtrum is posterior to this line the face is concave.

comment: Heel-to-toe gait is normally achieved in children around three years of age, after which tip-toe gait must be differentiated from habitual toe gait, congenital short tendo calcaneus, cerebral palsy, syringomyelia, spinal tumor, hematoma in a lower limb muscle, or neuromuscular diseases like muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies. If the toe gait persists for 2-3 years, this gait pattern is not considered to be habitual. Therefore, the judgment of habitual toe gait should not be determined without evaluation for other diseases.

comment: Traditionally a distinction is made between a Short penis, a short penis with otherwise normal anatomy, versus microphallus, a short penis with hypospadias. Penile length is the distance between the midline attachment of the gently stretched, flaccid penis above the pubic symphysis and tip of the glans. A short penis should be differentiated from an inconspicuous penis, for instance due to excessive suprapubic fat ("buried"). We also recognize that shortness of a penis is defined by some subspecialists as penile length more than 2.5 SD below the mean.

def: "A connective tissue neoplasm formed by proliferation of mesodermal cells. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Sarcoma is usually highly malignant." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).

alt_id: HP:0000595
def: "A form of loss of vision caused by damage to the visual cortex rather than a defect in the eye." [HPO:probinson, PMID:28082927]
comment: The term cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) was coined to describe damage to visual pathways and structures occurring during early perinatal development. The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric populations of non-ocular cause, and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However, as further characterization of this condition progressed, it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including subcortical structures, white matter pathways, as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus, the word cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer, and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature, the HPO will regard these terms as synonymous. It is recommended that more specific terms be used as appropriate for annotation.

def: "A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.

def: "Nontender, round and firm, but slightly compressible, intradermal or subcutaneous cyst measuring 0.5-5 cm in diameter. Epidermal cysts are intradermal or subcutaneous tumors, grow slowly and occur on the face, neck, back and scrotum. They usually appear at or around puberty, and as a rule an affected individual has one solitary or a few cysts." [HPO:skoehler]
comment: A cyst is a cavity containing liquid, semisolid, or solid material. An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that develops out of ectodermal tissue and consists of a thin layer of squamous epithelium. An epidermal cyst may or may not be painful or release pus, and are usually noticed as a bump on the skin. Epidermal cysts and trichilemmal cysts are clinically indistinguishable. The wall of the epidermal cyst conserves the epidermal layers, but the wall of the trichilemmal cysts, which arise from the external root sheath, shows palisading of unlayered epithelial cells. Homogeneous horny material that is further degraded to fat and cholesterol forms within both types of cysts.
