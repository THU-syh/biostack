Materials and Methods 
Animals and treatment. 
We used adult (60-day-old) Sprague-Dawley male and female rats (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) for these studies. Animals were housed in suspended stainless steel wire cages and maintained in compliance with federal guidelines for animal care (Human Health Extension Act of 1985, Public Law 99-158) with appropriate institutional animal care and use committee approval and were treated humanely with regard for alleviation of suffering. Rats were maintained under climate-controlled conditions on a 12-hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 0600 hr) with food (Harlan Teklad Global Diet no. 2014 containing no alfalfa, soybean, or phytoestrogen components; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and water provided ad libitum. Male and female rats were acclimated to this environment for at least 3 weeks before the initiation of the studies. 
For the cycling studies, daily vaginal smears were collected from eight adult female rats housed under standard conditions and given tap water containing 2% Tween 80 vehicle as a drinking solution for 30 days to establish baseline controls and confirm that the animals were cycling in a normal fashion. This vehicle has no significant effects on ovarian cyclicity in rats or on male or female sexual behavior relative to tap water controls (Mani et al. 2005; Markaverich et al. 1988, 2002a, 2002b). On day 31, the cycling female rats were given a 1:1 mixture of the 9,10-dihy-droxy-12-octadecenoic acid [leukotoxin diol (LTX-diol)] isomers (2  g/mL) in the tap water Tween 80 vehicle for an additional 30 days. This dose was chosen on the basis of previous published studies with the THF-diols, which are structurally similar to the LTX-diols (Figure 1) and which we suspected would have similar biologic activities. Daily vaginal smears were collected throughout the 30-day treatment period and evaluated for cyclicity as previously described (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). In this particular study, the female rats served as their own controls because their ovarian cycles were determined before and after LTX-diol treatment. Previous studies with the THF-diols demonstrated that equivalent results are obtained with separate groups of controls or treated animals or with animals serving as their own controls (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). 
To determine whether the LTX-diols affect male reproductive function, three replicate studies employing six established adult male Sprague-Dawley breeder rats were performed as previously reported for the THF-diols (Mani et al. 2005; Markaverich et al. 1988, 2002a, 2002b). The male breeder rats who had side litters at least three times were housed under reversed lighting conditions in hanging wire cages and were provided a drinking solution containing LTX-diol isomers (2 g/mL of drinking solution) for 1 4 weeks. Sexual behavior was evaluated by examining the number of mounts, intromissions, ejaculations, ejaculation latencies (in seconds), and grooming frequencies in a 30-min test period with each sexually receptive female as per well-established procedures in our laboratories (Hull et al. 1990). Ovariectomized steroid-primed Sprague-Dawley female rats were used as stimulus animals and were brought into behavioral estrus by a subcutaneous priming injection of 2  g estradiol benzoate in sesame oil 48 hr before receiving 100  g progesterone (subcutaneously), as previously described (Markaverich et al. 2002b). 
Reagents and solvents. 
We obtained linoleic acid and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). N,O,-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro-acetamide with 10% trimethyl chlorosilane (BSTFA) was obtained from Pierce Chemical (Rockford, IL). We purchased Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (3 cc) from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA), and C18 minicolumns from Varian (Walnut Creek, CA). All solvents were HPLC grade from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). 
Purification of peak II from corncob bedding. 
We prepared the ethyl acetate extract of ground corncob bedding as previously described (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). The dried extract was redissolved in approximately 20 mL HPLC-grade methanol, and 2 mL aliquots were analyzed on a Beckman Gradient HPLC System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a diode array detector and a Dynamax Ultrasphere-Octyl HPLC column (Varian). The column was equilibrated in acetonitrile (CH3CN):water (30:70) containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. A linear gradient to 40% CH3CN was initiated 5 min after injection and completed by 90 min. Fractions (1 min) were collected, and triplicate aliquots were assayed for mitogenic activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 
Mitogenic effects of HPLC fractions and synthetic LTX-diol on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. 
For the assessment of mitogenic activities of the various preparations on MCF-7 cells, we followed previously described methods (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). Briefly, we added the aliquots of the HPLC fractions (1 5  L) or HPLC-purified synthetic LTX-diol isomers in redistilled ethanol to cultured MCF-7 cells grown in phenol red free Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium (DMEM) containing 5% charcoal-stripped, sulfatase-treated fetal calf serum. Cell number was determined 7 days after treatment by hemocytometer counts or by the MTT (methyl thiazoyl tetrazolium) absorbance assay (Markaverich et al. 2002a). HPLC fractions containing peak II of mitogenic activity (Figure 2) were collected on C18 mini-columns (Varian, Lake Forest, CA) and analyzed by GC-MS. The mass spectra of the TMS (trimethylsilylether) derivatives of the two isomers were in agreement with those reported in the literature (Halankar et al. 1989). Synthetic LTX-diol and 12,13-dihy-droxy-9-octadecenoic acid (iso-LTX-diol) were redissolved in 100% redistilled ethanol and added to the cultured cells. 
GC-MS studies. 
For GC-MS analysis, the HPLC peak components or authentic compounds were derivatized by a number of procedures. We prepared the trimethylsilyl ethers by adding a 1:4 mixture of BSTFA:CH3CN to the dried samples, which were vortexed and heated at 70 C for 30 min. Methyl esters of the carboxylic acids in the HPLC fractions or synthetic compounds were prepared by redissolving the dried samples in methanol:1 N HCl (1:3) and heating at 70 C for 60 min. The samples were taken to dryness under nitrogen and redissolved in methanol before analysis. We performed catalytic hydrogenation to reduce double bonds in the unknowns or synthetic compounds by redissolving the dried samples in 1 mL methanol in the presence of a small amount of platinum while bubbling H2 gas slowly into the sample to evaporate the methanol. The dried material was redissolved in methanol and centrifuged to remove the platinum pellet. The sample was transferred to a clean vial and taken to dryness under nitrogen, and the TMS derivative was prepared as described above. 
The derivatized samples were analyzed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph interfaced with a Finnigan SSQ 7000 mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a DB-1 column (12.5 m, 0.2 mm inner diameter, 0.0.33  m film coating; P.J. Cobert, St. Louis, MO). The initial temperature of 120 C was held for 1 min after sample injection, increased linearly to 270 C at 10 C/min, and held at 270 C for 5 min. For electron ionization, the source temperature, electron energy, and emission current were 200 C, 100 eV, and 300  A, respectively. For chemical ionization, the source temperature, electron energy, and emission current were 140 C, 240 eV, and 300  A, respectively. Methane was used as carrier gas for chemical ionization. The injector and transfer line temperatures were 250 C. 
Synthesis of 9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic and 12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acids. 
The epoxy acids were synthesized from linoleic acid as previously described (Zheng et al. 2001), with slight modifications. Linoleic acid (10 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL methylene chloride. mCPBA (70 mg) was added to the sample, and the mixture was stirred at 22 C for 5 hr. The reaction mixture was washed sequentially with 1 mL portions of 25 mM NH4HCO3, saturated saline solution, and H2O. The washed extract was evaporated to dryness under N2, and the waxy white solid was stored at  20 C. 
Synthesis and purification of LTX-diol and iso-LTX-diol. 
Approximately 20 mg of the waxy white solid described above was dissolved in THF:H2O:5% perchloric acid (5:1:1) and stirred at 22 C for 1 hr. The products were extracted into ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness under vacuum. LTX-diol and iso-LTX-diol were separated from linoleic acid and THF-diols in these synthetic mixtures by chromatography on C18 reverse-phase mini-columns. To accomplish the separation, the dry synthetic mixture was redissolved in approximately 300  L CH3CN. This solution was applied to a C18 minicolumn pre-equilibrated with 2 mL CH3CN and 4 mL 0.5% acetic acid. The column was washed with 40% CH3CN in 0.5% acetic acid to elute residual by-products of the mCPBA. The column was then eluted with 50% CH3CN in 0.5% acetic acid to obtain the THF-diols. Elution with 60% CH3CN/0.5% acetic acid facilitated the collection of an isomeric mixture of LTX-diol and iso-LTX-diol. Linoleic acid elutes from the C18 minicolumns with higher concentrations (> 70%) of CH3CN and therefore was removed from these LTX-diol preparations. The identity and purity of the eluents and contaminants in each of the above fractions were confirmed by GC-MS. 
HPLC separation of LTX-diol and iso-LTX-diol. 
To compare the biologic activities of the two isomers, separation of LTX-diol and iso-LTX-diol was performed on a Beckman HPLC system equipped with an Altex Ultrasphere-ODS semipreparative column (10 mm   25 cm) (Beckman Coulter) eluted isocratically with 45% CH3CN containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. Compounds were detected at 203 nm with a Beckman diode array detector. The peaks at 32 and 36 min were confirmed by GC-MS to be pure iso-LTX-diol and LTX-diol, respectively. 
Effects of LTX-diol and iso-LTX-diol on MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation. 
The LTX-diol isomers isolated by HPLC were taken to dryness under nitrogen at 50 C, weighed, and redissolved at known concentrations in 100% ethanol for the cell proliferation assays as described above. Briefly, MCF-7 cells grown as described above were treated with a range of LTX-diol or iso-LTX-diol concentrations (0.1 10  g/mL), and cell number was determined 7 days after treatment, as described previously (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). The isomers had equivalent biologic activity in the MCF-7 cell proliferation assay; therefore, the mixture was used for the remaining studies. 
LTX-diol competition for [3H]estradiol binding to ER and type II sites in rat uterine nuclear fractions. 
Earlier studies on partially purified ground corncob extracts containing the mitogenic activity revealed that these preparations did not compete for [3H]estradiol binding to ER or nuclear type II [3H]estradiol binding sites. This was later confirmed with pure preparations of synthetic THF-diol (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). Thus, we suspected that the biologic effects of the LTX-diols were probably not mediated via direct interactions with either ER or the nuclear type II sites because the LTX-diols are structurally related to the THF-diols. To directly evaluate these possibilities, we assessed LTX-diol competition for [3H]estradiol binding to ER or type II sites (Markaverich et al. 2002a, 2002b). Briefly, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and implanted with 20- g estradiol-containing beeswax pellets to promote nuclear ER retention and stimulate nuclear type II sites (Markaverich et al. 2002b). Seven days after treatment, the uteri were removed from these animals, stripped of extraneous tissues, weighed, and chilled in ice-cold saline before analysis. For ER competition studies, rat uterine tissue was homogenized in 10 mM Tris, 1.5 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 at 22 C, and uterine nuclear suspensions were incubated at 37 C for 30 min in the presence of 10 nM [3H]estradiol   0.01 10  M LTX-diol or diethylstilbestrol (DES) under conditions that measure only [3H]estradiol binding to ERs (Markaverich et al. 1981). For type II site competition studies, uterine tissue was homogenized in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1.5 mM EDTA) and nuclear suspensions were incubated at 4 C   60 min in the presence of 30 nM [3H]estradiol   0.00015 30  M LTX-diol or luteolin (a competitive inhibitor of type II sites but not ERs) under conditions that measure [3H]estradiol binding to type II sites but not occupied ERs. After incubation, the nuclear suspensions for ER or nuclear type II site assays were washed 3 times by resuspension and centrifugation (800   g   7 min) in 1 mL TE buffer, and the final washed pellets were extracted with 1 mL 100% ethanol. Radioactivity in the ethanol extract was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Markaverich et al. 1981). [3H]Estradiol binding in the absence of competitor (controls) was approximately 10,000 cpm for ERs and 30,000 cpm for type II sites. Results were expressed as the percentage of [3H]estradiol bound in the presence of the indicated concentrations of LTX-diol, DES, or luteolin relative to the vehicle control (100%). 
Statistical analyses. 
We analyzed data from cell proliferation assays and animal cycling studies (body weights, fluid consumption) statistically by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey s test on the treatment means using InStat (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The data recorded from the behavioral tests for male sexual behavior (data not shown) were compared using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn s method for post hoc comparison using Graph Pad Prism software, version 4 (Graph Pad Software Inc.).
