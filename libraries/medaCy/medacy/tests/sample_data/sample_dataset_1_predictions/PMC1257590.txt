Materials and Methods 
Animals. 
Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University, where all studies using animals were performed. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (250 300 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were used. The rats were ovariectomized under ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine anesthesia (3 mL/kg intramuscular injection of a cocktail containing 25 mg ketamine, 1.2 mg xylazine, and 0.03 mg acepromazine in 1 mL saline). 
Morphologic studies. 
One week after ovariectomy, animals were treated with estrogen, using groups of three animals per treatment condition. In the first PSSD study, 15 rats (five groups of three rats) were injected subcutaneously with either 17  -E2 (60  g/kg; 12 rats) or the sesame oil vehicle (200  L; three rats). Nine of the 12 estradiol-treated animals were treated simultaneously with increasing doses (40, 120, and 400  g/kg) of BPA (> 99% purity; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). In the second PSSD experiment, 12 rats were injected subcutaneously (three rats per treatment) with 17  -E2 (45  g/kg), BPA (300  g/kg), a combination of 17  -E2 (45  g/kg) plus BPA (300  g/kg), or the sesame oil vehicle (200  L) alone. Thirty minutes after injection, animals were sacrificed under deep ether anesthesia by transcardial perfusion of heparinized saline followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.35). The brains were removed and postfixed overnight in the same fixative without glutaraldehyde. The hippocampi were then dissected out, and 100  m vibratome sections were cut perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. The approximately 90 vibratome sections were divided into 10 subgroups using systematic random sampling and were flat-embedded in Araldite (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA, USA). 
To correct for processing-induced changes in the volume of the tissue, we calculated a correction factor assuming that the treatments did not alter the total number of pyramidal cells. In all hippocampi, we examined six or seven disector pairs (pairs of adjacent 2- m semi-thin sections mounted on slides and stained with toluidine blue). We calculated a pyramidal cell density value (D) using the formula D = N/sT, where N is the mean disector score across all sampling windows, T is the thickness of the sections (2  m), and s is the length of the window. Based on these values, a dimensionless volume correction factor kv was introduced: kv = D/D1, where D1 is the mean cell density across the groups of hippocampi (Rusakov et al. 1997). 
To exclude the possibility that alterations in PSSD might be a consequence of changes in the volume of reference, we used a subset of the vibratome sections for volume estimation of the stratum radiatum of CA1, using the Cavalieri s principle (Gundersen and Jensen 1987). Areas of CA1 stratum radiatum were measured in each section using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD, USA), and the total volume of CA1 stratum radiatum in each rat was estimated as 
where T is the distance between the top of one sampled section and the top of the next section, and A(CA1SR) is the measured area of CA1 stratum radiatum for each section. 
Thereafter, serial ultrathin sections were cut from randomly sampled vibratome sections and collected on formvar-coated single-slot grids. Disector pairs of digitized electron micrographs ( reference  and  look-up ) were taken from adjacent ultrasections at a magnification of 11,000  in a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) furnished with an AMT Advantage 4.00 HR/HR-B CCD camera system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), from an area located between the upper and middle third of the CA1 stratum radiatum (300 500  m from the pyramidal cell layer; Leranth et al. 2004). Identical regions in adjacent sections were identified using landmarks such as myelinated fibers, large dendrites, or blood vessels that did not change significantly between neighboring sections. The investigator taking the electron micrographs was blinded to the treatment of individual animals. Areas occupied by potentially interfering structures such as blood vessels, large dendrites, or glial cells were subtracted from the measured fields. The digitized electron micrographs were printed out using a laser printer and coded. The code was not broken until the analysis was completed. Synapses were counted using a two-dimensional unbiased counting frame with an area of 79  m2 superimposed on the electron microscopic prints. Only those spine synapses were counted that were present in the reference micrograph but not in the look-up micrograph, and vice versa. At least 10 disector pairs were photographed on each electron microscopic grid. With at least three grids (containing two adjacent ultrathin sections) prepared from each vibratome section (cut from three different regions of the hippocampus along its longitudinal septotemporal axis), each animal provided at least 3   3   10   2 = 180 neuropil fields for evaluation. The density of spine synapses in each animal was calculated as 
where  Q(syn) is the total number of synapses sampled by the disector; 2   90 = 180 is the number of evaluated electron micrographs per animal; the section thickness t was measured by the method of Small s smallest fold (Weibel 1979; average 0.075  m); and 79 is the area of the counting frame in square micrometers. PSSD for each animal was calculated by dividing Nv(syn) by the volume correction factor kv. 
Rat uterine weight assay. 
To assess uterotrophic responses, a separate group of 12 rats (four groups of 3) was treated 1 week after ovariectomy with subcutaneous injections of 17  -E2 (60  g/kg), BPA (400  g/kg), or the combination of BPA (400  g/kg) and 17  -E2 (60  g/kg), daily for 3 days. Control animals received the sesame oil vehicle (200  L/day) alone. Six hours after the last injection, the animals were sacrificed; their uteri were dissected free of adhering fat and connective tissue, drained of intraluminal fluid, and weighed. 
Statistical analysis. 
Results, in all cases, are presented as mean   SD of observations from three animals per treatment group. We have verified that the use of three animals per treatment group provides sufficient statistical power to detect effects of the magnitude typically observed after steroid replacement, because of the precision obtained by analyzing large numbers of sections per animal. SDs for counting CA1 synapses in this laboratory are usually < 5% of mean PSSD. With an SD of 5% and sample sizes of three per group, a 15% change in mean PSSD can be detected with   = 0.05 and 80% power. In the present studies, SDs for measurement of PSSD were in most instances considerably < 5% of mean. 
Data were analyzed statistically using Statview (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or SPSS for Windows (Systat Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We used Bartlett s test to verify homogeneity of variance. One- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni-Dunn test were used for comparison of individual treatment groups. When only control versus treatment comparisons were considered, we used the Student t-test. Four-parameter least-squares regression analysis of the BPA dose response data was performed using ALLFIT (DeLean et al. 1978).
