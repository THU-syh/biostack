    "#### The goal of Computational Healthcare Library is to help computer scientists do high impact healthcare research by providing a simple interface to large publicly available healthcare datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Computational Healthcare library you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load & analyze data from up to 200 Million visits & 70 Million patients\n",
    "- Specify aggregation strategies and compute aggregate statistics in a privacy preserving manner   \n",
    "- Build embedding models, perform transfer learning, predict rehospitalizations/revisits using TensorFlow \n",
    "- Benchmark results against baseline algorithms trained on publicly available datasets\n",
    "- In future it can be used for testing Differential Privacy algorithms for computing aggregate statistics & privacy preserving Machine Learning   \n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Healthcare library (chlib) is also used for building [Computational Healthcare: A Medical Search & Aggregation Engine](http://www.computationalhealthcare.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, follow instructions in [README.md](https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/ComputationalHealthcare/blob/master/README.md). Once the docker container is running, you can provide the CSV file and run prepare_nrd.sh to process and load NRD dataset. After processing is finished, you can go to localhost:8888 to use jupyter notebook server running inside container. Open this notebook (inside blog/introduction.ipynb) inside jupyter. "
