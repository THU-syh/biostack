# Computational Healthcare Library 
The goal of Computational Healthcare Library is to help computer scientists perform high impact healthcare research 
by providing a simple interface to large publicly available healthcare datasets. 



### Please visit [Computational Healthcare Library](http://www.computationalhealthcare.com/library) for more information and documentations

With Computational Healthcare library you can:
- Build [Outcomes prediction engine](http://www.computationalhealthcare.com/ML)  
- Load & analyze data from up to 200 Million visits & 70 Million patients
- Specify aggregation strategies and compute aggregate statistics in a privacy preserving manner   
- Build embedding models, perform transfer learning, predict rehospitalizations/revisits using TensorFlow 
- Benchmark results against baseline algorithms trained on publicly available datasets
- In future it can be used for testing Differential Privacy algorithms for computing aggregate statistics & privacy preserving Machine Learning


**Please note that this repository does not contains any data, nor do we provide any data. You should acquire the datasets 
on your own from AHRQ or other state agencies.**
