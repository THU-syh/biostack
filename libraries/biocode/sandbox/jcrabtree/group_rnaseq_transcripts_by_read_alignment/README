Some timing experiments with the goal of speeding up group_rnaseq_transcripts_by_read_alignment.
The initial tests used a couple of small prefixes of the full BAM alignment file, created by 
running this script:

make-test-inputs.sh

The subdirectories are as follows:

1-original-script/
  Check the speed of the original script (with a minor mod to allow reading SAM from stdin):
  NOTE: Running these tests also revealed that the original script is not grouping transcripts 
  correctly and may return different results from run to run. 

2-read-bam-only/
  Baseline experiment to determine the amount of time it takes to read the entire SAM/BAM file.

3-timing-tests/
  A series of experiments to see which part(s) of the script are slowing things down.

4-new-script/
  A new version of the script that addresses the speed and correctness issues.
